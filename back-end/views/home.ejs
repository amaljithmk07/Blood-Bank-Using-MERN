            <h1> Blood Basics</h1>
            <p> Blood is a specialized body fluid. It has four main components: plasma, red blood cells, white blood
                cells,
                and platelets. Blood has many different functions, including:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                <li> transporting oxygen and nutrients to the lungs and tissues</li>
                <li>forming blood clots to prevent excess blood loss</li>
                <li> carrying cells and antibodies that fight infection</li>
                <li> bringing waste products to the kidneys and liver, which filter and clean the blood</li>
                <li> regulating body temperature</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The blood that runs through the veins, arteries, and capillaries is known as whole blood, a mixture of
                about 55 percent plasma and 45 percent blood cells. About 7 to 8 percent of your total body weight is
                blood. An average-sized man has about 12 pints of blood in his body, and an average-sized woman has
                about nine pints. </p> <br><br>

            <h1>The Components of Blood and Their Importance</h1>
            <p> Many people have undergone blood tests or donated blood, but hematology - the study of blood -
                encompasses
                much more than this. Doctors who specialize in hematology (hematologists) are leading the many advances
                being made in the treatment and prevention of blood diseases.</p>

            <p>If you or someone you care about is diagnosed with a blood disorder, your primary care physician may
                refer
                you to a hematologist for further testing and treatment.</p>
            <h1> Plasma</h1>
            <p> The liquid component of blood is called plasma, a mixture of water, sugar, fat, protein, and salts. The
                main
                job of the plasma is to transport blood cells throughout your body along with nutrients, waste products,
                antibodies, clotting proteins, chemical messengers such as hormones, and proteins that help maintain the
                body's fluid balance.</p>

            <h1> Red Blood Cells (also called erythrocytes or RBCs)</h1>
            <p>Known for their bright red color, red cells are the most abundant cell in the blood, accounting for about
                40
                to 45 percent of its volume. The shape of a red blood cell is a biconcave disk with a flattened center -
                in
                other words, both faces of the disc have shallow bowl-like indentations (a red blood cell looks like a
                donut).</p>
            <p>Production of red blood cells is controlled by erythropoietin, a hormone produced primarily by the
                kidneys. Red blood cells start as immature cells in the bone marrow and after approximately seven days
                of maturation are released into the bloodstream. Unlike many other cells, red blood cells have no
                nucleus and can easily change shape, helping them fit through the various blood vessels in your body.
                However, while the lack of a nucleus makes a red blood cell more flexible, it also limits the life of
                the cell as it travels through the smallest blood vessels, damaging the cell's membranes and depleting
                its energy supplies. The red blood cell survives on average only 120 days.</p>

            <p>Red cells contain a special protein called hemoglobin, which helps carry oxygen from the lungs to the
                rest of the body and then returns carbon dioxide from the body to the lungs so it can be exhaled. Blood
                appears red because of the large number of red blood cells, which get their color from the hemoglobin.
                The percentage of whole blood volume that is made up of red blood cells is called the hematocrit and is
                a common measure of red blood cell levels.</p>

                Transfusion Service.</p>
